## API

### Formatting

Formatting is now extremely simple and uses the same parameters as
[PHP's date function](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php) as well as the escape sequence (backslash).

``` javascript
Date.format(date, formatStr)
new Date().format(formatStr)
```

### Scheduling

Want to schedule a function to be called at a certain time? Well, it couldn't be any easier.

``` javascript
Date.schedule(date, callback[, context])
new Date().schedule(callback[, context])
```

If the date is *now* or in the past it will simply be called immediately. Also, if you change your mind you can just
prevent it from being called.

``` javascript
Date.unschedule(scheduleId)
new Date().unschedule(scheduleId)
```

The `scheduleId` is returned by the call to `schedule` and will be unique for every call. However, This will be
`undefined` in cases where the function was called immediately.

### Miscellaneous

The library also comes packed with a few more simple - yet extremely useful - everyday methods.

``` javascript
new Date().addDays(days)
new Date().addHours(hours)
new Date().addMilliseconds(milliseconds)
new Date().addMinutes(minutes)
new Date().addMonths(months)
new Date().addSeconds(seconds)
new Date().addYears(years)
new Date().clear()
new Date().clearDate()
new Date().clearTime()
new Date().getDayOfYear()
new Date().getDaysInMonth()
new Date().getTimezone()
new Date().getWeekOfYear()
new Date().getYearOfWeek()
new Date().isDaylightSavingTime()
new Date().isLeapYear()
```
